**foamclient** facilitates receiving data and meta data at scientific user facilities, 
in which libraries such as ZeroMQ and Redis are predominantly used. It is used in the 
**foam** family libraries such as [foamcore](https://github.com/zhujun98/foamcore.git) and 
[foamlight](https://github.com/zhujun98/foamlight.git). Users can also use it to customize 
their own data processing workflows.
